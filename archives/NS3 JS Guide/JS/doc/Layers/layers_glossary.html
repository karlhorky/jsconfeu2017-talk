<P>This glossary describes elements of HTML and JavaScript syntax needed
to implement a Web page using the new layers feature in the Navigator 4.0
component of Netscape Communicator Preview Release. In addition, several
simple ideas for ways to enhance Web pages are presented. </P>

<P>The functionality of the new <TT>&lt;LAYER&gt;</TT> tag allows you to
define precisely positioned, overlapping layers of transparent or opaque
content in a Web page. With a little JavaScript code, you can move layers,
hide them, and change the order in which they overlap. With layers you
can use HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic animations on a Web page.
</P>

<P>The Navigator 4.0 component in the Preview Release extends the objects
and methods available in JavaScript to contain a <I>Layer object</I> and
a <I>Layers array</I> that enumerates all the layers in a document. This
allows dynamic control of the position, visibility, and z-order (stacking
order) of layers. </P>

<P>As future versions of Netscape Communicator are released, additonal
tags and functionalities will be added to this glossary. Check back here
for updates. For <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/library/documentation/communicator/index.html">more

<DL>
<DT><B>LAYER</B></DT>

<DD>The <TT>&lt;LAYER&gt;</TT> tag starts a layer, and the <TT>&lt;/LAYER&gt;</TT>
tag ends the layer. All the content between the opening and closing layer
tag can be treated as a single layer of content that can be moved, clipped,
and altered in various ways. For example, you could have many overlapping
layers that can be dynamically peeled away to reveal the layers underneath.</DD>

<P> Layers have a stacking order that determine which layer appears on
top of another for overlapping layers. Using JavaScript you can dynamically
change whether a layer is visible or not, which means you can hide a layer
and make it reappear again if you want. </P>

<P>Each pixel in a layer can be transparent or solid. If a pixel is transparent,
the content of underlying layers shows through it. You can specify background
images and background colors for layers just as you do for body page. Specifying
a background color causes the entire layer to become opaque. Tiled background
images can contain transparent pixels.</P>

<P> If you resize a browser while it is showing a page containing layers
that have been dynamically changed by JavaScript, the layers reset to their
initial state. That is, they reset to the state they were in when the page
was first loaded.</P>

<P> </P>

<P><A NAME="nametag"></A></P>

<DT><B>NAME=</B><I>&quot;layerName&quot;</I></DT>

<DD>This is an identification tag for the layer. Layer names must begin
with an alphabetic character. The name is used for referring to the layer
from within HTML and external scripting languages such as JavaScript. Each
layer name within a document must be unique. This attribute is optional;
by default all layers are unnamed.</DD>

<P><A NAME="lefttag"></A></P>

<DT><B>LEFT=</B><I>xPosition</I></DT>

<P><A NAME="toptag"></A></P>

<DT><B>TOP=</B><I>yPosition</I></DT>

<DD>The LEFT and TOP attributes specify the pixel position or relative
position (in percent) of the layer in terms of the horizontal and vertical
position of the top left corner of the layer. The origin is the upper left
corner of the parent layer or document, with coordinates increasing downwards
and to the right. The values must be integer values in the range [-2147483648,
2147483647]; these are the limits of a 32-bit, signed integer. The default
values for both LEFT and TOP correspond to the position of the content
of the tag if the tag did not exist. That is, the current layout position
when the tag is encountered.<BR>
</DD>

<PRE>   &lt;LAYER LEFT=20 TOP=100&gt;
</PRE>

<PRE>   This layer appears 20 pixels in from the left and 100 pixels down from the top of the parent layer.
</PRE>

<PRE>   &lt;/LAYER&gt;
</PRE>

<DL>
<P>Both attributes are optional. After the <TT>&lt;LAYER&gt;</TT> tag is
encountered, subsequent HTML layout will resume at the XY location of layout
before the <TT>&lt;LAYER&gt;</TT> tag was encountered. </P>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="widthtag"></A></P>

<DT><B>WIDTH=</B><I>layerWidth</I></DT>

<DD>The WIDTH attribute controls how the contents of the <TT>&lt;LAYER&gt;</TT>
tag will be wrapped. It is specified in terms of pixels and must be an
integer in the range [-2147483648, 2147483647]; these are the limits of
a 32-bit, signed integer, or as a percentage. If elements that cannot be
wrapped, such as images, extend beyond the width specified, the actual
width of the contents of the layer will be larger than the specified value.
This behavior is analogous to the way in which the width of a window sets
the default wrapping for any HTML it contains. The attribute is optional;
in the absence of a WIDTH specification, the layer contents wrap at the
right boundary of the enclosing block. </DD>

<P><A NAME="heighttag"></A></P>

<DT><B>HEIGHT=</B><I>layerHeight</I></DT>

<DD>HEIGHT acts as a reference length for attribute values in child layers
that are specified using percentages.</DD>

<P><A NAME="cliptag"></A></P>

<DT><B>CLIP=</B>&quot;<I>x1_offset, y1_offset, x2_offset, y2_offset</I>&quot;
or <B>CLIP=</B>&quot;<I>x2_offset, y2_offset</I>&quot; </DT>

<DD>The CLIP attribute specifies a rectangle containing the portion of
the contents to be drawn. Everything outside this rectangle is drawn as
transparent and so is invisible. This clip is expressed in a coordinate
system where the LEFT and TOP of the layer space is the origin. </DD>

<P>The CLIP attribute is specified with four numbers, in pixels, and must
be an integer in the range [-2147483648, 2147483647]; these are the limits
of a 32-bit, signed integer, or as a percentage. These are the x1_offset,
y1_offset, x2_offset, and y2_offset, where the x1 and y1 offsets specify
the upper left corner of the displayed region relative to the layer's LEFT
and TOP position values, and the x2 and y2 offsets specify the lower right
corner. So, the numbers specified in the attribute from left to right should
be the horizontal left value, the vertical top value, the horizontal right
value, and the vertical bottom value. </P>

<P>If x1_offset and y1_offset are omitted, they default to (0,0) (that
is, the coordinates specified by the layer's LEFT and TOP attributes).
In this case, the x2 and y2 offsets still represent the lower right corner.
If CLIP is omitted entirely, x2_offset and y2_offset are chosen such that
everything within the layer is unclipped - that is, visible. </P>

<P><A NAME="zindextag"></A></P>

<DT><B>Z-INDEX=</B><I>layerZ</I></DT>

<P><A NAME="abovetag"></A></P>

<DT><B>ABOVE=</B>&quot;<I>layerName</I>&quot;</DT>

<P><A NAME="belowtag"></A></P>

<DT><B>BELOW=</B>&quot;<I>layerName</I>&quot;</DT>

<DD>The Z-INDEX, ABOVE, and BELOW attributes specify the z-order (stacking
order) of layers, overriding the default behavior of placing new layers
on top of all existing layers. Only one of the Z-INDEX, ABOVE, or BELOW
attributes may be used for a given layer. </DD>

<DD>The Z-INDEX attribute allows a layer's z-order to be specified in terms
of a positive integer. Layers with higher-numbered <I>layerZ </I>values
are stacked above those with lower ones. </DD>

<DD>The ABOVE attribute specifies the NAME attribute of the layer immediately
on top of a newly created layer. In other words the new layer is created
just <I>below </I>the layer specified by the ABOVE attribute. Similarly,
the BELOW attribute identifies the NAME attribute of the layer that will
be immediately underneath the newly created layer. For either attribute,
the specified layer must already have been created. Forward references
to other layers are not permitted and will result in the default layer-creation
behavior (as if the ABOVE or BELOW attribute had not appeared). </DD>

<P><A NAME="vistag"></A></P>

<DT><B>VISIBILITY=</B>SHOW | HIDE | INHERIT</DT>

<DD>The VISIBILITY attribute is used to determine whether the layer is
initially displayed. SHOW, which is not implemented in the preview release,
indicates that the layer should be drawn, HIDE indicates that the layer
should be hidden, and INHERIT indicates that the layer's visibility should
always be the same as its parent layer's visibility. The attribute is optional;
by default, VISIBILITY=INHERIT. The hidden state of a layer can be changed
dynamically by using a scripting language.</DD>

<P><A NAME="bgcolortag"></A></P>

<DT><B>BGCOLOR=</B><I>&quot;rgbColor&quot;</I></DT>

<P><A NAME="backtag"></A></P>

<DT><B>BACKGROUND=</B><I>&quot;imageURL&quot;</I></DT>

<DD>These attributes control the solid background color or tiled image
backdrop of a layer. They are similar to the BGCOLOR and BACKGROUND attributes
of the &lt;BODY&gt; tag. BGCOLOR is either the name of a standard color
or an RGB value. BACKGROUND is the URL of a backdrop image. Backdrop images
may contain transparent pixels. Both of these attributes are optional.
By default, a layer is transparent - layers below a layer with neither
attribute show through in the areas in which a background color or pattern
would have been visible.</DD>

<P><A NAME="srctag"></A></P>

<DT><B>SRC=</B><I>URL</I></DT>

<DD>All the content in the page referenced by URL is placed in the layer.</DD>

<P><A NAME="nolayertag"></A></P>

<DT><B>NOLAYER</B></DT>

<DD>All HTML between the &lt;NOLAYER&gt; and &lt;/NOLAYER&gt; is ignored
in Communicator.</DD>
</DL>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>L</FONT>AYERS IN <FONT SIZE=+2>HTML: I</FONT>DEA
<FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT>LOSSARY </H3>

<P>This section illustrates several simple ways in which Web page layout
has been enhanced by the addition of the <TT>&lt;LAYER&gt;</TT> tag. This
section is by no means comprehensive; rather, it contains enough ideas
to start working with layers. </P>

<P><A NAME="layoutcontrol"></A><B>Layout Control</B> </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The inability to control the positions of HTML elements has become an
issue for media-rich content. Before the advent of layers, Navigator laid
out HTML objects in a sequential, planar fashion. Now, by specifying the
upper left corner of a layer using the LEFT and TOP attributes, HTML blocks
can be precisely positioned inside Navigator's window. For example, a layer
containing an image and &lt;H1&gt; formatted text can be specified to appear
at coordinates 0,20. Subsequent HTML layers can be positioned precisely
relative to this layer. Additionally, layers can be made to appear above
or below other HTML elements on the page. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
<A NAME="background"></A><B>Background Images and Colors</B> </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In previous versions of Navigator, background images and colors were
restricted to the background of the entire document or to tables within
a document. With layers, multiple parts of a page can have different background
colors and background patterns. Transparency and the overlapping of multiple
layers can be used to achieve even more interesting visual effects. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
<A NAME="nested"></A><B>Nested Layers</B> </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nested layers without JavaScript could be used as a layout method for
hierarchical documents in the same way that entire HTML tables are often
placed within table cells. For example, to make something that looked like
an aquarium, you would need a solid-colored rectangle to serve as a fish
tank and some fish images. It might look like this: </P>

<PRE>     &lt;!-- Define a layer with a background to serve as the &quot;fish tank&quot;--&gt;
     &lt;LAYER NAME=&quot;FISHTANK&quot; BACKGROUND=&quot;LIGHT BLUE&quot; CLIP=500,200&gt;
       &lt;LAYER TOP=100 LEFT=100&gt;
           &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;grouper.gif&quot;&gt;
       &lt;/LAYER&gt;
       &lt;LAYER TOP=200 LEFT=200&gt;
           &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;grouper.gif&quot;&gt;
       &lt;/LAYER&gt;
       &lt;LAYER TOP=200 LEFT=200&gt;=&gt;
           &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;lionfish.gif&quot;&gt;
       &lt;/LAYER&gt;
     &lt;/LAYER&gt;
</PRE>

<P>The positions of all the fish images are defined relative to the parent
&quot;FISHTANK&quot; layer, so if you decided to change the placement of
the fish tank on the page, you wouldn't have to change the coordinates
of each individual fish image - they would all move with the fish tank
layer. </P>

<P>Note that hiding a parent hides the children if their VISIBILITY attribute
is INHERIT. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
<A NAME="hidden"></A><B>Hidden Layers</B> </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The hidden property of the <TT>&lt;LAYER&gt;</TT> tag allows certain
layers to be displayed or hidden initially. By adding simple JavaScript
statements, one can produce dynamic hiding effects with layers. However,
hidden layers can be useful even without JavaScript. Consider, for example,
a developer who wishes to hide HTML form elements without using the HIDDEN
form input type. By using hidden layers, the developer could hide entire
form elements (for example, text and selection entries) from view. </P>

<P>A layer can be referenced in JavaScript using the Layers array, which
contains an entry for each object that has been created. Objects in the
Layers array can be accessed using either a non-negative integer index
or by using the name of the layer specified by its <TT>NAME</TT> attribute.
When accessed using an integer index, the array elements appear in z-order
from back to front, with zero being the bottommost layer and higher layers
indexed by consecutive integers. Note that the array index of a layer is
not the same as its <TT>z</TT> property, because the latter does not necessarily
enumerate layers with unique consecutive integers.</P>

<P> </P>

<DL>
<DT>The following represent valid ways of accessing Layer objects:</DT>

<DD><TT>document.<I>layerName<BR>
</I>document.layers[<I>index</I>]<BR>
document.layers[&quot;<I>layerName</I>&quot;]</TT></DD>
</DL>

<P>Elements of the Layers array are JavaScript objects that cannot be set
by assignment, though their properties can be set. For example, the statement</P>

<P> </P>

<DD><TT>document.layers[0]=&quot;music&quot;</TT></DD>

<P>is invalid and will be ignored because it attempts to alter the Layers
array. However, some properties of the objects in the array are both readable
and writable. Thus, for example, the statement</P>

<P> </P>

<DD><TT>document.layers[&quot;somelayer&quot;].left = 100</TT></DD>

<P>is perfectly valid; it represents the intended use of the Layers array.</P>

<P> The number of layers in a document can be obtained from the length
property of the Layers array:</P>

<P> </P>

<DD><TT>document.layers.length</TT></DD>

<P>Note: in PR3 and later, each layer has its own document property, similar
to the document property of a window. Therefore, to access an image in
a layer, a script outside the layer would use:</P>

<P> </P>

<DD><TT>window.document.layers[&quot;layerName&quot;].document.image[m]</TT></DD>

</FONT>L<FONT SIZE=-1>AYERS</FONT> </B></P>

<P>A broad spectrum of interesting and useful visual effects can be achieved
by hiding and showing layers using the <TT><A HREF="#visiblity">visibility</A></TT>
property. Layers that have been defined in HTML with the attribute <TT>VISIBILITY</TT>
set to <TT>HIDE</TT> are initially hidden when a page is loaded. By setting
the <TT>VISIBILITY</TT> attribute of a hidden layer to <TT>SHOW</TT>, you
can make layers (containing arbitrary HTML) appear suddenly via the use
of JavaScript events. Similarly, visible layers can go away, either temporarily
or permanently.</P>

<P> A simple example of this might be a form containing a checkbox labeled
&quot;Add me to your mailing list.&quot; Initially this checkbox appears
all by itself. When the user checks the checkbox, a text entry field for
the user's email address appears - it isn't necessary to reload the page.</P>

<P> By using several hidden layers, you can achieve even more effects.
For example, you can create a movie with variable frame rates by hiding
and showing several layers containing static images in a sequence (use
of this animation effect is described below). Another example might be
a page containing a paragraph of text that changes when the user's mouse
passes over various menu items.</P>

<P> <A NAME="moving"></A><B>M<FONT SIZE=-1>OVING </FONT>L<FONT SIZE=-1>AYERS</FONT>
</B></P>

<P>Using the Layer object's <TT><A HREF="#left">left</A></TT> and <TT><A HREF="#right">right</A></TT>
properties, the <TT>offset()</TT> method, or the <TT>moveTo()</TT> method,
layers can be dynamically moved after a page has been drawn. Visible layers
can be made to jump across the page, and hidden layers can be moved into
position before they are displayed.</P>

<P> Consider, for example, a puzzle consisting of a three-by-three grid
containing eight tiles, each of which is a piece of a larger picture. Because
there are nine squares and only eight tiles, there will always be one empty
square. When the user clicks on a tile adjacent to the empty square, the
tile changes places with the empty square. In this way a &quot;shuffled&quot;
image can be repeatedly rearranged until the correctly configured image
is constructed. To implement this, you would make each tile an image within
a layer. When the user clicks on a tile (we can tell this by using the
<TT><A HREF="../JavaScript Guide/ref_m-q.htm#onClick_event">onClick()</A></TT>
event handler), its layer is repositioned so that the tile appears over
the empty square.</P>

<P> As another example, consider how balloon help might be implemented.
A layer is drawn containing a large, empty &quot;balloon,&quot; much like
the ones used in cartoons. Additionally, for each area on a page, several
layers are defined using chunks of HTML that describe the area. All these
layers are initially hidden. When the user moves the mouse over one of
the page areas (we can tell this by using the <TT><A HREF="../JavaScript Guide/ref_m-q.htm#onMouseOver_event">onMouseOver()</A></TT>
and <TT><A HREF="../JavaScript Guide/ref_m-q.htm#onMouseOut_event">onMouseOut()</A></TT>
event handlers in conjunction with a layer containing a totally transparent
image), the balloon layer is repositioned over that area of the page. Then,
the layer with the info for that area of the page is repositioned over
the balloon layer. Finally, both the balloon layer and the info layer are
made visible.</P>

<P> Please note that in Preview Release 1, these event handlers only apply
to imagemaps. In future releases, they could be event handlers for layers.
</P>

<P><A NAME="reclipping"></A><B>R<FONT SIZE=-1>ECLIPPING</FONT> L<FONT SIZE=-1>AYERS</FONT>
</B></P>

<P>The Layer object's <TT><A HREF="#clip">clip</A></TT> property and <TT><A HREF="#resize">resize()</A></TT>
method allow the portion of a layer that is displayed to be changed.</P>

<P> A pull-down menu is an example of this. To create a pull-down menu,
a layer is defined that shows a complete menu, including its title. The
<TT>CLIP</TT> attribute of this layer is defined in such a way that only
the title of the menu is visible when the page is initially loaded. Subsequently,
when the user clicks the title of the menu, the layer's clipping is changed
so that the entire menu is visible. When the user then clicks one of the
menu items, the menu layer's <TT>clip</TT> property is reset to its original
value.</P>

<P> By combining the reclipping method described in the above example with
a layer's <TT>left</TT> and <TT>right</TT> properties, you can create &quot;scrollable&quot;
layers. As an example, consider a layer containing a very large amount
of HTML. To fit into a page's layout, only a small part of this HTML is
made visible by clipping the layer. Next to the clipped layer is a down
arrow image. When the user clicks the arrow, the layer is reclipped so
that the visible portion of the layer is 10 pixels lower within the layer.
To compensate for the movement of the visible part of the layer, the entire
layer moves up 10 pixels. The net effect of these changes is that the content
of the layer seems to scroll whenever the down arrow is clicked.</P>

<P> <A NAME="animation"></A><B>A<FONT SIZE=-1>NIMATION</FONT> </B></P>

<P>Under the right circumstances, repeatedly performing any of the functions
described above results in layer animation. For example, layers need not
jump across the page when they are moved. If a layer is moved from its
original position to its final position in increments, it seems to slide
across the page. You can control the sliding speed by adjusting how far
the layer moves in each increment and how much time passes between increments.</P>

<P> To animate a layer, you use the <TT><A HREF="../JavaScript Guide/ref_s-s.htm#setTimeout_method">setTimeout()</A></TT>
method within a recursive function to separate each modification to the
layer's properties. Consider the following example code: </P>

<P><TT>function moveSomeLayer()<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>code which performs one movement of your layer(s)
goes here</I> </TT></P>

<P><TT>function layer_timeout()<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moveSomeLayer();<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set Timeout(&quot;layer_timeout()&quot;,100); </TT></P>

<P><TT>layer_timout();</TT> </P>

<P>Each of the following examples illustrates animation in conjunction
with hiding and showing layers, moving layers, and reclipping layers. Imagine
that a whole section of HTML needs to fade away gradually until it disappears.
This HTML content appears on top of a solid white background. To achieve
this effect, nine GIF images are created. Each image has a certain percentage
of opaque white pixels; the remaining pixels are transparent. The opaque
pixels are distributed within the image in a pattern. The images contain
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent opaque pixels. Each
image is used as the background pattern in a hidden layer. Each hidden
layer has the same dimensions and position as the section of HTML that
needs to be faded. By rapidly hiding and showing these layers in succession
until the 100 percent layer is visible, the HTML content appears to fade
into white.</P>

<P> For the next example, imagine that a GIF image of a ball needs to be
made to bounce around a certain region of a Web page. First, a layer containing
the ball image is created. Next, the <TT>LEFT</TT> and <TT>TOP</TT> attributes
of the layer are stored in global variables. Then, four functions are written
to move the layer a small number of pixels diagonally up and to the right,
down and to the right, down and to the left, and up and to the left using
the <TT>offset()</TT> method. Finally, these functions are called in succession
to create the desired bouncing ball action.</P>

<P> Finally, consider the pull-down menu example described in the <A HREF="#reclipping">Reclipping
Layers</A> section above. Rather than having the menu pop up instantly,
the menu can be made to scroll open. This effect can be achieved by repeatedly
resetting the layer's <TT>clip.bottom</TT> property. </P>
