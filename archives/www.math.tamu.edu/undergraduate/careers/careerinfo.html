<h1 class="pageTitle">Career Options</h1>

<h3>Career lines linked with mathematics degrees</h3>

<p>
Mathematics without a doubt is a beautiful subject, and it is an
indispensable tool in science and engineering. Students who earn a
degree in mathematics have training that will enable them to enter
almost any career path. Medicine and Law are two careers that are not
commonly associated with mathematics, yet there are individuals in
these professions who owe their success, at least partly, to a
knowledge of mathematics. From understanding the genetic code to
designing hacker proof web transmissions, to guiding a spacecraft to
its ultimate destination mathematics is a needed tool.
</p>


<h2>Career options with an Applied Mathematics Degree</h2>

<p>
The BS degree in Applied Mathematics has six emphases: Math, Actuarial Science, 
Economics, Statistics, Computational Science, and Biological Science. 
The APMS degree is the most flexible degree and prepares students for 
the widest possible number of careers.
 
</p>


<p>
Over half of the APMS graduates seeking employment directly after graduation 
look to business, in particular consulting firms and technical companies. 
All of these companies are looking for people with good problem solving skills. 
Employers need to be able to train new employees to solve their particular 
technical problems. In the broadest possible terms, math graduates are hired 
to work as part of a problem solving team.  The best way to determine 
what is currently hot is to go to the Engineering Job Fair, the Sciences 
Career Fair, and the Career Center.  


</p>


<p><b>Math Emphasis: </b> Students getting a BS in Applied Mathematics with the Math Emphasis 
   have prepared themselves for graduate school in Mathematics and employment with 
   high-tech firms, engineering firms, and consulting companies. The career opportunities 
   with high-tech firms will depend in part on a student's programming ability and 
   willingness to take a job which requires some programming. Recently Hewlett Packard 
   hired a graduate to work in their mathematical programming group. Texas Systems and 
   Tivoli Systems hire graduates to be software engineers. All these jobs require 
   employees to be able to both program and do mathematics. There is a high demand 
   for mathematicians with programming skills. However, the type of high-tech jobs 
   that are available changes greatly from year to year. 
</p>


<p>
 <b>Actuarial Science Emphasis:</b>  Students pursuing an Applied Mathematics degree with 
 the Actuarial Science Emphasis have chosen a degree that is suited to a career in 
 business, particularly actuarial and financial consulting.  An actuary is a 
 mathematician who analyzes risk.  Pension actuaries work with client firms to 
 help them determine their retirement liability and funding status, while casualty 
 actuaries work in insurance firms and run statistical models to determine proper 
 insurance premiums.  Actuarial and financial consulting firms that have hired 
 recent graduates include AIG, Aon Hewitt, EY, Fidelity, Forethought Financial, 
 Houston Casualty Company, Mercer, Towers Watson, and USAA.  A minor in business 
 or economics is well suited to this degree plan.  Some graduates with this degree 
 go on to graduate school in finance, economics, or business, but if you are 
 interested in a graduate-level mathematics or mathematical finance degree, you 
 will need to take additional mathematics courses.  Those who want to pursue this 
 degree but are also interested in teacher certification should consider Post Bac 
 Certification or emergency certification.  
</p>


<p>
<b>Statistics Emphasis: </b> The government always needs mathematicians.  The CIA, NSA, 
FBI, NIST and Census Bureau need mathematically trained personnel.  Some former 
students have been hired by the state transportation division.  Most of the students 
who graduate with an APMS/STAT degree go on to graduate school in statistics.  
At present, there is a shortage of statisticians.  A Masters in Statistics will 
greatly improve the chance for a high paying job.  Career options also greatly 
increase with a masters degree.  People with a masters degree have recently 
found positions with banks, INTEL, pharmaceutical firms, and biotech firms. 




</p>


<p>
<b>Economics Emphasis: </b> Like the Actuarial Science Emphasis, graduates of this degree 
plan can be hired to be business analysts, financial analysts, and actuaries.  
A minor in business is well suited to this degree plan.  Some graduates with 
this degree go on to graduate school in economics, finance, and business.  
A Masters degree will greatly improve the chance for a high paying job.  
Career options also greatly increase with a Masters degree.   

</p>


<p>
<b>Computational Science Emphasis: </b> Some graduates with this degree will go on to 
graduate school in Computer Science or seek employment with such companies as 
Apple, Google, and Microsoft, and government agencies such as NSA, and NASA.  
A Masters in Computer Science will greatly improve both pay and career options 
both at places listed for the BS and other types of firms needing advanced IT help. 

</p>
<p>
<b>Biological Sciences Emphasis: </b> Students graduating with an APMS degree with an Emphasis 
in the Biological Sciences have chosen a degree that is suited to a career in applications 
of mathematics to the life sciences. The 21st century has been dubbed the Century of the 
Life Sciences. The life sciences are poised for revolutionary advances in this century. 
Among the many areas of the life sciences in which mathematics makes enabling contributions are:  
genomics, computational neuroscience, modeling human and animal physiology,  epidemiology,  
ecology, and  pharmacology.  Breakthroughs in these fields will be made by interdisciplinary 
teams of scientists, statisticians and mathematicians working in commercial (industrial) 
laboratories, governmental laboratories, privately or publicly funded research centers, 
and universities. Information on career opportunities in mathematics applied to the life 
sciences can be found at the websites of the Society for Mathematical Biology (http://www.smb.org/) 
and the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (http://www.siam.org/). A minor in
biology or some other area of the biological sciences is well suited to this degree plan. 
This degree plan will prepare you for graduate work in mathematics or statistics with an 
emphasis in applications to the biological sciences. People interested in teaching as one 
of several possible options should consider Post Bac Certification or Emergency Certification. 
If you are interested in this option, there are specific math courses that should be chosen 
for your math elective courses. 

<h2>Career Options With a Mathematics Degree</h2>

<p>
The BS in Mathematics is the "pure mathematics" degree.  The mathematics courses required by this 
degree prepare students for graduate school in mathematics, physics, and engineering.  Because 
this option requires a total of 26 hours of science courses, 10 hours more than the APMS degree, 
it is also a good degree for students who are intersted in science as well as mathematics and 
pre-med students. If you are planning to attend a medical school, the BS and BA in Mathematics 
are the best degree plans. Please see the Office of Professional School Advising (OPSA) 
website for more details: http://opsa.tamu.edu/index.shtml.   
</p>


<p>
For students not planning to pursue an advanced degree, the jobs open to graduates with a 
BS in Mathematics are similar to the job opportunities of APMS/MATH graduates. Technical 
companies that have hired recent graduates include Microsoft, Apple, Google, and CGG Veritas. 
These firms hire people to be software engineers and to design web pages. Software development 
firms can pay very well, but they expect prospective employees to be able to program. This degree 
plan only requires 4 hours of computer science, so it would be wise to take one or two more 
CSCE courses if you want a job with a high tech firm. <br> 

In summary, there are many job opportunities available with this degree, but this degree will 
not train you for a specific profession. It would be best to start attending job fairs in your 
freshman year to get an idea of what sort of jobs interest you and what courses besides math 
courses will strengthen your resume.
 
</p>


<p>
The BA in Mathematics is designed primarily for students who are interested in teaching, 
pursuing a professional degree in medicine or law, and those students who are interested 
in both mathematics and some other area.  The BA in Mathematics requires the fewest number 
of hours of mathematics and has 27 hours of free electives, but it does require that at least 
15 hours be taken in some focused area of study other than mathematics. Students planning to 
attend a professional school (medical, dental, law, etc.) may use the 27 hours of free electives 
for courses required for the school. Please see the Office of Professional School Advising (OPSA) 
website for more details:  http://opsa.tamu.edu/index.shtml.  
</p>



<p>
Students interested in the liberal arts and who can write will find that this degree plan 
with a minor in English or Communications is greatly desired by employers. In particular, technical 
firms frequently need people who can produce a logical argument and then explain it to others. 
Newspapers and publishing houses are other places such graduates are valued.  
</p>


<p>
In closing, there are many exciting careers available to students with
a degree in Mathematics or Applied Mathematics. The need for
mathematicians is increasing and Texas A&amp;M University has eight
excellent programs which prepare our students to meet the
challenge. If you have any questions as to which program would be best
for you, an advisor would be happy to discuss your interests.
