<h1>The JavaScript Object Model</h1>

<p>JavaScript is based on a  simple object-oriented paradigm.  
An object is a construct with properties that are JavaScript variables.
Properties can be other objects.  Functions associated with an object are known as the 
object's <i>methods</i>.
<P>
In addition to objects that are built into the Navigator client and the LiveWire server,
you can define your own objects.

<UL>
<LI><a href="#objprop">Objects and Properties</a>
<LI><a href="#funcmeth">Functions and Methods</LI></a>
<LI><a href="#newobj">Creating New Objects</LI></a>
</UL>

<a name="objprop"> <h2>Objects and Properties</h2></a>

<p>A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. You access the properties of an 
object with a simple notation:
<pre>
objectName.propertyName
</pre>
<p>
Both the object name and property name are case sensitive. 
You define a property by assigning it a value. For example, suppose there is an object
named <i>myCar</i> (we'll discuss how to create objects later-for now, just assume the object
already exists). You can give it properties named <b>make</b>, <b>model</b>,
and <b>year</b> as follows: 
<pre>
myCar.make = "Ford"
myCar.model = "Mustang"
myCar.year = 69;
</pre>
<P>
You can also refer to these properties using an array notation as follows:
<PRE>
mycar["make"] = "Ford
myCar["model"] = "Mustang"
myCar["year"] = 69;
</PRE>
<p>This type of an array is known as an associative array, because each
index element is also associated with a string value. To illustrate how this works,
the following function displays the properties of the object, when you
pass the object and the object's name as arguments to the function: 
<pre>function show_props(obj, obj_name) { 
    var result = &quot&quot; 
    for (var i in obj) 
        result += obj_name + &quot.&quot + i + &quot = &quot + obj[i] + &quot\n&quot; 
    return result; 
} </pre>

<p>So, the function call <tt>show_props(myCar, &quotmyCar&quot)</tt> would
return the following: 
<pre>myCar.make = Ford
myCar.model = Mustang
myCar.year = 67</pre> 
<P>
You may also define properties using ordinal numbers, for example:
<PRE>
temp[0] = 34
temp[1] = 42
temp[2] = 56
</PRE>
These statements create three properties of the object <i>temp</I>, and you must refer
to these properties as temp[<i>i</i>], where <i>i</i> is an integer between 0 and 2.


<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a name="funcmeth"><h2>Functions and Methods</h2></a>
<P>
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.
A function is a JavaScript procedure--a set of statments that performs a specific task.  
<P>
A function definition consists of the <b>function</b> keyword, followed by
<UL>
<LI>the name of the function 
<LI>a list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses, and separated by commas
<LI>the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces, {...}
</UL>
<P>
In a Navigator application, you can use any functions defined in the current page. 
It is generally a good idea to define all your functions in the <code>HEAD</code> of a page.
When a user loads the page, the functions will then be loaded first.  

<P>
The statements in a function can include other function calls defined for the 
current application.

<P>
For example, here is the definition of a simple function named pretty_print:
<XMP>
function pretty_print(string) {
   document.write("<HR><P>" + string)
}
</XMP>
<P>
This function takes a string as its argument, adds some HTML tags to it using the concatenation 
operator (+), then displays the result to the current document.
<P>
Defining a function does not execute it.
You have to <i>call</i> the function for it to do its work.
For example, you could call the pretty_print function as follows:
<XMP>
<SCRIPT>
pretty_print("This is some text to display")
</SCRIPT>
</XMP>
<P>
The arguments of a function are not limited to just strings and numbers.
You can pass whole objects to a function, too.
The show_props function from the previous section is an example of a function that takes 
an object as an argument.
<P>
The arguments of a function are maintained in an array.
Within a function, you can address the parameters passed to it as follows:
<pre>
<i>functionName</i>.arguments[<i>i</i>]
</pre>
where <i>functionName</i> is the name of the function and <i>i</i> is the ordinal 
number of the argument, starting at zero.  So, the first argument passed to a function named
myfunc would be myfunc.arguments[0].  The total number of arguments is indicated by the variable
arguments.length.

<P>
A function can even be recursive, that is, it can call itself.  For example, here is a function that computes factorials:
<PRE>
function factorial(n) {
  if ((n == 0) || (n == 1))
    return 1
  else {
    result = (n * factorial(n-1) )
    return result
  }
}
</PRE>

<P>
You could then display the factorials of one through five as follows:
<PRE>
for (x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
   document.write(x, " factorial is ", factorial(x))
   document.write("<BR>")
}
</PRE>
<P>
The results would be:
<BR>
0 factorial is 1
<BR>1 factorial is 1
<BR>2 factorial is 2
<BR>3 factorial is 6
<BR>4 factorial is 24
<BR>5 factorial is 120

<h3>Functions with Variable Numbers of Arguments</h3>
<P>
You can call a function with more arguments than it is formally declared to accept
using the <I>arguments</I> array.  This is often useful if you don't know beforehand 
how many arguments will be passed to the function.
You can use arguments.length to determine the number of arguments actually passed to the function,a
and then treat each argument using the arguments array.
<P>
For example, consider a function defined to create HTML lists.
The only formal argument for the function is a string that is "U" if the list is to be unordered
(bulleted) or "O" if the list is to be ordered (numbered).  The function is defined as follows:
<XMP>
function list(type) {
   document.write("<" + type + "L>")                // begin list
   for (var i = 1; i < list.arguments.length; i++)  // iterate through arguments
      document.write("<LI>" + list.arguments[i])
   document.write("</" + type + "L>")               // end list
}
</XMP>
<P>
You can pass any number of arguments to this function and it will then display each argument as
an item in the indicated type of list.  For example, the following call to the function:
<PRE>
list("o", "one", 1967, "three", "etc, etc...")
</PRE>
<P>
results in this output:
<script>
function list(type) {
   document.write("<" + type + "L>")                // begin list
   for (var i = 1; i < list.arguments.length; i++)  // iterate through arguments
      document.write("<LI>" + list.arguments[i])
   document.write("</" + type + "L>")               // end list
}
list("o", "one", 1967, "three", "etc, etc...")
</script>



<h3>Defining Methods</h3>
<P>
A <i>method</i> is a function associated with an object.  You define a method in the same way
as you define a standard function.  Then, use the following syntax to associate the function
with an existing object:
<pre>
<i>object.methodname = function_name</i>
</pre>
where <i>object</i> is an existing object, <i>methodname</i> is the name you are assigning to
the method, and <i>function_name</i> is the name of the function.
<P>
You can then call the method in the context of the object as follows:
<pre>
object.methodname(params);
</pre>

<h3>Using this for Object References</h3>
<P>
JavaScript has a special keyword, <b>this</b>, that you can
use to refer to the current object.  For example, suppose you have a function called
<i>validate</i> that validates an object's value property, given the object, and the 
high and low values:
<pre>
function validate(obj, lowval, hival) {
   if ((obj.value < lowval) || (obj.value > hival))
      alert("Invalid Value!")
}
</pre>
<P>
Then, you could call <i>validate</i> in each form element's 
onChange event handler, using <b>this</b> to pass it the form element, as in the 
following example:

<xmp>
<INPUT TYPE = "text" NAME = "age" SIZE = 3 onChange="validate(this, 18, 99)">
</xmp>

<P>
In general, in a method <b>this</b> refers to the calling object.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a name="newobj"> <h2>Creating New Objects</h2></a>
<P>
Both client and server JavaScript have a number of predefined objects.
In addition, you can create your own objects.
Creating your own object requires two steps:
<UL>
<LI>Define the object type by writing a function.
<LI>Create an instance of the object with <b>new</b>.
</UL>
<P>
To define an object type, create a function for the object
type that specifies its name, and its properties and methods.

For example, suppose you want to create an object type for cars.
You want this type of object to be called <i>car</i>, and you want it
to have properties for make, model, year, and color.
To do this, you would write the following function:
<PRE>
function car(make, model, year) {
   this.make = make; 
   this.model = model;
   this.year = year;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Notice the use of <b>this</b> to assign values to the object's properties based 
on the values passed to the function.
<P>
Now you can create an object called <i>mycar</i> as follows:
<PRE>
mycar = new car("Eagle", "Talon TSi", 1993);
</PRE>
<P>
This statement creates <i>mycar</i> and assigns it the specified values for its properties.
Then the value of <code>mycar.make</code> is the string "Eagle", <code>mycar.year</code>
is the integer 1993, and so on.
<P>
You can create any number of <i>car</i> objects by calls to <b>new</i>.
For example, 
<PRE>
kenscar = new car("Nissan", "300ZX", 1992)
</PRE>
<P>
An object can have a property that is itself another object.
For example, suppose I define an object called <i>person</i> as follows:
<PRE>
function person(name, age, sex) {
   this.name = name;
   this.age = age;
   this.sex = sex;
}
</PRE>
<P>
And then instantiate two new <i>person</i> objects as follows:
<PRE>
rand = new person("Rand McNally", 33, "M")
ken = new person("Ken Jones", 39, "M")
</PRE>
<P>
Then we can rewrite the definition of <i>car</i> to include an owner property
that takes a <i>person</I> object, as follows:
<PRE>
function car(make, model, year, owner) {
   this.make = make; 
   this.model = model;
   this.year = year;
   this.owner = owner;
}
</PRE>
<P>
To instantiate the new objects, you then use the following:
<PRE>
car1 = new car("Eagle", "Talon TSi", 1993, rand);
car2 = new car("Nissan", "300ZX", 1992, ken)
</PRE>
<P>
Notice that instead of passing a literal string or integer value when creating the
new objects, the above statements pass the objects rand and ken as the arguments for the owners.
Then if you want to find out the name of the owner of car2, 
you can access the following property:
<PRE>
car2.owner.name
</PRE>
<P>
Note that you can always add a property to a previously defined object.
For example, the statement:
<pre>
car1.color = "black"
</pre>
adds a property color to car1, and assigns it a value of "black".
However, this does not affect any other objects.
To add the new property to all objects of the same type, you have to add the property to the
definition of the <i>car</i> object type.

<h3>Defining Methods</h3>
<P>
You can define methods for an object type by including a method defnition in the 
object type definition.  For example, suppose you have a set of image GIF files,
and you want to define a method that displays the information for the cars, along with the
corresponding image.  You could define a function such as:
<pre>
function displayCar() {
   var result = "A Beautiful " + this.year 
                + " " + this.make + " " + this.model;
   pretty_print(result)
}
</pre>
where <i>pretty_print</i> is the previously defined function to display a string.
Notice the use of <b>this</b> to refer to the object to which the method belongs.
<P>
You can make this function a method of <i>car</i> by adding the statement
<pre>this.displayCar = displayCar;</pre> 
to the object definition. So, the full definition of <i>car</i> would now 
look like:

<PRE>
function car(make, model, year, owner) {
   this.make = make; 
   this.model = model;
   this.year = year;
   this.owner = owner;
   this.displayCar = displayCar;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Then you can call this new method as follows:
<pre>
car1.displayCar()
car2.displayCar()
</pre>
This will produce output like this:
<P>
<HR>
A Beautiful 1993 Eagle Talon TSi
<P>
<HR>
A Beautiful 1992 Nissan 300ZX
