<A NAME="expr"> <H2>Expressions</H2></A>

<P>
An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators,
and expressions that evaluates to a single value. 
The value may be a number, a string, or a logical value.

Conceptually, there are two types of expressions:
those that assign a value to a variable, and those that simply
have a value. For example, the expression
<P>
<CODE>x = 7</CODE> 
<P>
is an expression that assigns x the value 7. This expression itself
evaluates to 7. Such expressions use <I>assignment operators.</I>
On the other hand, the expression
<P>
<CODE>3 + 4</CODE> 
<P>
simply evaluates to 7; it does not perform an assignment. The
operators used in such expressions are referred to simply as <I>operators</I>.
<P>
JavaScript has the following kinds of expressions:
<UL>
<LI>Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example
<LI>String: evaluates to a character string, for example "Fred" or "234"
<LI>Logical: evaluates to true or false
</UL>
<P>
The special keyword <b>null</b> denotes a null value.  
In contrast, variables that have not been assigned a value are <i>undefined</i>, and cannot
be used without a run-time error.

<H3>Conditional Expressions</H3>
<P>
A conditional expression can have one of two values based on a condition.
The syntax is
<pre>
(<i>condition</i>) ? <i>val1</i> : <i>val2</i>
</pre>
<P>
If <i>condition</i> is true, the expression has the value of <i>val1</i>,
Otherwise it has the value of <i>val2</i>.  
You can use a conditional expression anywhere you would use a standard
expression.
<P>
For example,
<pre>
status = (age >= 18) ? "adult" : "minor"
</pre>
This statement assigns the value "adult" to the variable status
if age is eighteen or greater.  Otherwise, it assigns the value
"minor" to status.

<H2>Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)</H2>

<P>
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based
on the value of its right operand. The basic assignment operator
is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to
its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.
<P>
The other operators are shorthand for standard arithmetic operations
as follows:
<UL>
<LI>x += y means x = x + y
<LI>x -= y means x = x - y
<LI>x *= y means x = x * y
<LI>x /= y means x = x / y
<LI>x %= y means x = x % y
</UL>

<P>
There are additional assignment operators for bitwise operations:
<UL>
<LI>x &lt;&lt;= y means x = x &lt;&lt; y
<LI>x &gt;&gt;= y means x = x &gt;&gt; y
<LI>x &gt;&gt;&gt;= means x = x &gt;&gt;&gt; y
<LI>x &amp;= means x = x &amp; y
<LI>x ^= means x = x ^ y
<LI>x |= means x = x | y
</UL>

<A NAME="operators"> <H2>Operators</H2></A>

<P>
JavaScript has arithmetic, string, and logical operators. There
are both <I>binary</I> and <I>unary</I> operators. A binary operator
requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the
operator:
<P>
<CODE><i>operand1 operator operand2</i></CODE> 
<P>
For example, 
<tt>3 + 4 or x * y</tt>
<P>
A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after
the operator:
<P>
<CODE>operator operand </CODE>
<P>
or
<P>
<CODE>operand operator</CODE> 
<P>
For example <tt>x++</tt> or <tt>++x</tt>.

<A NAME="arithop"> <H3>Arithmetic Operators</H3></A>

<P>
Arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or
variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value.

<H4>Standard Arithmetic Operators</H4>

<P>
The standard arthmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*),
and division (/). These operators work in the standard way.

<H4>Modulus (%)</H4>

<P>
The modulus operator is used as follows: 
<BR><CODE>var1 % var2</CODE> 
<P>
The modulus operator returns the first operand modulo the second
operand, that is, <I>var1</I> modulo <I>var2</I>, in the statement
above, where <I>var1</I> and <I>var2</I> are variables. The modulo
function is the remainder of integrally dividing <I>var1</I> by <I>var2</I>. 
For example, 12 % 5 returns 2.

<H4>Increment (++)</H4>

<P>
The increment operator is used as follows:
<BR>
<CODE>var++ </CODE>or <CODE>++var</CODE> 
<P>
This operator increments (adds one to) its operand and returns a value. 
If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example x++), then it
returns the value before incrementing. If used prefix with operator before 
operand (for example, ++x), then it returns the value after incrementing.
<P>
For example, if x is 3, then the statement
<P>
<CODE>y = x++</CODE> 
<P>
increments x to 4 and sets y to 3.
<P>
If x is 3, then the statement
<P>
<CODE>y = ++x</CODE> 
<P>
increments x to 4 and sets y to 4.

<H4>Decrement (--)</H4>

<P>
The decrement operator is used as follows:
<P>
<CODE>var-- </CODE>or <CODE>--var</CODE> 
<P>
This operator decrements (subtracts one from) its operand
and returns a value. If used postfix (for example x--) then it
returns the value before decrementing. If used prefix (for example,
--x), then it returns the value after decrementing.
<P>
For example, if x is 3, then the statement
<P>
<CODE>y = x--</CODE> 
<P>
decrements x to 2 and sets y to 3.
<P>
If x is 3, then the statement
<P>
<CODE>y = --x</CODE> 
<P>
decrements x to 2 and sets y to 2.

<H4>Unary negation (-)</H4>

<P>
The unary negation operator must precede its operand. It negates
its operand. For example,
<P>
x = -x
<P>
negates the value of x; that is if x were 3, it would become -3.

<A NAME="bitwiseop"> <H3>Bitwise Operators</H3></a>
<P>
Bitwise operators treat their operands as a set of bits (zeros and ones), 
rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.
For example, the decimal number 9 has a binary representation of 1001.
Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations, 
but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.

<H4>Bitwise Logical Operators</H4>

<P>
The bitwise logical operators work conceptually as follows:
<ul>
<li>The operands are converted to 32-bit integers, and expressed
a series of bits (zeros and ones).
<li>Each bit in the first operand is paired with the corresponding bit in the second
operand: first bit to first bit, second bit to second bit, and so on.
<li>The operator is applied to each pair of bits, and the result is constructed
bitwise.
</ul>
<P>
The bitwise operators are:
<UL>
<LI>Bitwise AND & returns a one if both operands are ones.
<LI>Bitwise OR | returns a one if either operand is one.
<LI>Bitwise XOR ^ returns a one if one but not both operands are one.
</UL>
<P>
For example, the binary representation of 9 is 1001, and the binary representation
of 15 is 1111.  So, when the bitwise operators are applied to these values, 
the results are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>15 & 9 yields 9 (1111 & 1001 = 1001)
<LI>15 | 9 yields 15 (1111 | 1001 = 1111)
<LI>15 ^ 9 yields 6 (1111 ^ 1001 = 0110)
</UL>

<H4>Bitwise Shift Operators</H4>
<P>
The bitwise shift operators are:
<UL>
<LI>Left Shift (&lt&lt;)
<LI>Sign-propagating Right Shift (&gt;&gt;)
<LI>Zero-fill Right shift (&gt;&gt;&gt;)
</UL>

<P>
The shift operators take two operands: the first is a quantity to be shifted, and the
second specifies the number of bit positions by which the first operand is
to be shifted.  The direction of the shift operation is controlled by the operator used.
<P>
Shift operators convert their operands to 32-bit integers, and return a result of
the same type as the left operator.

<H5>Left Shift (&lt&lt;)</H5>
<P>
This operator shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the left.
Excess bits shifted off to the left are discarded.  Zero bits are shifted in from 
the right.
<P>
For example, 9<<2 yields 36, because 1001 shifted two bits to the left becomes 100100, 
which is 36.

<H5>Sign-propagating Right Shift (&gt;&gt;) </H5>
<P>
This operator shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the right.
Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded.
Copies of the leftmost bit are shifted in from the left.
<P>
For example, 9>>2 yields 2, because 1001 shifted two bits to the right becomes 10, 
which is 2.  Likewise, -9>>2 yields -3, because the sign is preserved.

<H5> Zero-fill right shift (&gt;&gt;&gt;)</H5>
<P>
This operator shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the left.
Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded.
Zero bits are shifted in from the left.

<P>
For example, 19>>>2 yields 4, because 10011 shifted two bits to the right becomes 100, 
which is 4.  For postive numbers, zero-fill right shift and sign-propagating right
shift yield the same result.


<A NAME="logicalop"> <H3>Logical Operators</H3></A>

<P>
Logical operators take logical (Boolean) values as operands.
They return a logical value. Logical values are <B>true</B> and <B>false</B>.

<H4>And (&amp;&amp;)</H4>

<P>
<B>Usage</B>: <CODE>expr1 &amp;&amp; expr2</CODE> 
<P>
The logical &quot;and&quot; operator returns true if both logical
expressions <I>expr1</I> and <I>expr2</I> are true. Otherwise,
it returns false. 

<H4>Or (||)</H4>

<P>
<B>Usage</B>: <CODE>expr1 || expr2</CODE> 
<P>
The logical &quot;or&quot; operator returns true if either logical
expression <I>expr1</I> or <I>expr2</I> is true. If both <I>expr1</I>
and <I>expr2</I> are false, then it returns false. 

<H4>Not (!)</H4>

<P>
<B>Usage</B>: <CODE>!expr</CODE> 
<P>
The logical &quot;not&quot; operator is a unary operator that 
negates its operand expression
<I>expr</I>. That is, if <I>expr</I> is true, it returns false,
and if <I>expr</I> is false, then it returns true.

<h4>Short-Circuit Evaluation</h4>
<P>
As logical expressions are evaluated left to right, they are tested for
possible "short circuit" evaluation using the following rule:
<UL>
<LI><B>false</B> && <i>anything</i> is short-circuit evaluated to <B>false</B>.
<LI><B>true</B> || <i>anything</i> is short-circuit evaluated to <B>true</B>.
</UL>
<P>
The rules of logic guarantee that these evaluations will always be correct.
Note that the <i>anything</i> part of the above expressions is not evaluated, so any
side effects of doing so do not take effect.


<A NAME="compop"> <H3>Comparison Operators (= =, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, !=)</H3></a>

<P>
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical
value based on whether the comparison is true or not. The operands
may be numerical or string values. When used on string values,
the comparisons are based on the standard lexicographical ordering.
<P>
The operators are:
<UL>
<LI>Equal (= =): returns true if the operands are equal.
<LI>Not equal (!=): returns true if the operands are not equal.
<LI>Greater than (&gt;): returns true if left operand is greater
than right operand. Example: x &gt; y returns true if x is greater
than y. 
<LI>Greater than or equal to (&gt;=): returns true if left
operand is greater than or equal to right operand. Example: x
&gt;= y returns true if x is greater than or equal to y.
<LI>Less than (&lt;): returns true if left operand is less than
right operand. Example: x &lt; y returns true if x is less 
than y. 
<LI>Less than or equal to (&lt;=):
returns true if left operand is less than or equal to right operand.
Example: x &lt;= y returns true if x is less than or equal to y.

</UL>

<A NAME = "stringop"> <H3>String Operators</H3></A>

<P>
In addition to the comparison operators, which may be used on
string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two
string values together, returning another string that is the union
of the two operand strings. For example,
<P>
<CODE>&quot;my &quot; + &quot;string&quot;</CODE> 
<P>
returns the string
<P>
<CODE>&quot;my string&quot;</CODE> 

<P>
The shorthand assignment operator += can also be used to concatenate strings.
For example, if the variable <tt>mystring</tt> is a string that has the value
"alpha", then the expression
<pre>mystring += "bet"</pre>
evaluates to "alphabet" and assigns this value to <tt>mystring</tt>.

<A NAME="precedence"> <H3>Operator Precedence</H3></A>

<P>
The <I>precedence</I> of operators determines the order they are
applied when evaluating an expression. You can override operator
precedence by using parentheses.
<P>
The precedence of operators, from lowest to highest is as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>comma ,
<DT>assignment = += -= *= /= %= &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;= &gt;&gt;&gt;=
&amp;= ^= |=
<DT>conditional ?:
<DT>logical-or ||
<DT>logical-and &amp;&amp;
<DT>bitwise-or |
<DT>bitwise-xor ^
<DT>bitwise-and &amp;
<DT>equality == !=
<DT>relational &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=
<DT>bitwise shift &lt&lt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
<DT>addition/subtraction + -
<DT>multiply/divide * / %
<DT>negation/increment ! ~ - ++ --
<DT>call, member () [] .
